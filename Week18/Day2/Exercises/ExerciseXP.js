/**
 * üåü Exercise 1: Class With Access Modifiers
What You Will Learn:

How to use access modifiers (private, protected, and public) in a class.
How to create methods that interact with private and protected properties.


Instructions:
Create a class Employee with the following properties:

A private property name of type string.
A private property salary of type number.
A public property position of type string.
A protected property department of type string.
Also, include a constructor to initialize these properties. Create a public method getEmployeeInfo that returns the employee‚Äôs name and position.

*/
class Employee {
    constructor(name, salary, position, department) {
        this.name = name;
        this.salary = salary;
        this.position = position;
        this.department = department;
    }
    getEmployeeInfo() {
        return `Employee: ${this.name}, Position: ${this.position}`;
    }
}
console.log(new Employee('John Doe', 50000, 'Developer', 'IT').getEmployeeInfo());
/* üåü Exercise 2: Readonly Properties In A Class
What You Will Learn:

How to use the readonly modifier to make class properties immutable.
How to prevent modifications to class properties after initialization.


Instructions:
Create a class Product with the following properties:

A readonly property id of type number.
A public property name of type string.
A public property price of type number.
Create a method getProductInfo that returns a string with the product‚Äôs name and price. Attempt to modify the id property after creating a new instance of the class and observe the result. */
class Product {
    constructor(id, name, price) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.price = price;
    }
    getProductInfo() {
        return `Product: ${this.name}, Price: ${this.price}`;
    }
}
const product = new Product(1, 'Laptop', 1000);
console.log(product.getProductInfo());
product.id = 2; // Cannot assign to 'id' because it is a read-only property.
/* üåü Exercise 3: Class Inheritance
What You Will Learn:

How to create a base class and extend it using inheritance.
How to reuse properties and methods from the base class.


Instructions:
Create a base class Animal with a public property name and a method makeSound that returns a string. Create a subclass Dog that extends Animal and overrides the makeSound method to return the sound a dog makes (‚Äúbark‚Äù). Create an instance of the Dog class and call the makeSound method. */
class Animal {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    makeSound() {
        return 'Sound';
    }
}
class Dog extends Animal {
    makeSound() {
        return 'Bark';
    }
}
console.log(new Dog('Buddy').makeSound()); // Bark
/* üåü Exercise 4: Static Properties And Methods
What You Will Learn:

How to use static properties and methods in a class.
How to access static members without creating an instance of the class.


Instructions:
Create a class Calculator with the following static methods:

add(a: number, b: number): number ‚Äì returns the sum of two numbers.
subtract(a: number, b: number): number ‚Äì returns the difference between two numbers.
Call these methods without creating an instance of the class. */
class Calculator {
    static add(a, b) {
        return a + b;
    }
    static subtract(a, b) {
        return a - b;
    }
}
console.log(Calculator.add(10, 5)); // 15
console.log(Calculator.subtract(10, 5)); // 5
function printUserDetails(user) {
    console.log(`ID: ${user.id}, Name: ${user.name}, Email: ${user.email}, Membership Level: ${user.membershipLevel}`);
}
const user = {
    id: 1,
    name: 'John Doe',
    email: 'johndoe@gmail.com',
    membershipLevel: 'Gold'
};
printUserDetails(user); // ID: 1, Name: John Doe, Email:
