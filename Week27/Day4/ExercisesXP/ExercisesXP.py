# What You Will Learn :
# Inheritance


# 🌟 Exercise 1 : Pets
# Instructions
# Using this code:

class Pets():
    def __init__(self, animals):
        self.animals = animals

    def walk(self):
        for animal in self.animals:
            print(animal.walk())

class Cat():
    is_lazy = True

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def walk(self):
        return f'{self.name} is just walking around'

class Bengal(Cat):
    def sing(self, sounds):
        return f'{sounds}'

class Chartreux(Cat):
    def sing(self, sounds):
        return f'{sounds}'


# Create another cat breed named Siamese which inherits from the Cat class.
# Create a list called all_cats, which holds three cat instances : one Bengal, one Chartreux and one Siamese.
# Those three cats are Sara’s pets. Create a variable called sara_pets which value is an instance of the Pet class, and pass the variable all_cats to the new instance.
# Take all the cats for a walk, use the walk method.

class Siamese(Cat):
    pass 

all_cats = [Bengal("Bengal", 3), Chartreux("Chartreux", 4), Siamese("Siamese", 2)]
sara_pets = Pets(all_cats)
sara_pets.walk()


# 🌟 Exercise 2 : Dogs
# Instructions
# Create a class called Dog with the following attributes name, age, weight.
# Implement the following methods in the Dog class:
# bark: returns a string which states: “<dog_name> is barking”.
# run_speed: returns the dogs running speed (weight/age*10).
# fight : takes a parameter which value is another Dog instance, called other_dog. This method returns a string stating which dog won the fight. The winner should be the dog with the higher run_speed x weight.

# Create 3 dogs and run them through your class.

class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age, weight):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.weight = weight

    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} is barking"

    def run_speed(self):
        return self.weight / self.age * 10

    def fight(self, other_dog):
        self_score = self.run_speed() * self.weight
        other_score = other_dog.run_speed() * other_dog.weight
        if self_score > other_score:
            return f"{self.name} wins the fight"
        elif self_score < other_score:
            return f"{other_dog.name} wins the fight"
        else:
            return "It's a tie"

dog1 = Dog("Buddy", 5, 20)
dog2 = Dog("Max", 3, 25)
dog3 = Dog("Bella", 4, 18)

print(dog1.bark())
print(dog2.run_speed())
print(dog3.fight(dog1))

# Exercise 3 see Dogs.py

# Exercise 4 : Family
# Instructions
# Create a class called Family and implement the following attributes:

# members: list of dictionaries
# last_name : (string)

# Implement the following methods:

# born: adds a child to the members list (use **kwargs), don’t forget to print a message congratulating the family.
# is_18: takes the name of a family member as a parameter and returns True if they are over 18 and False if not.
# family_presentation: a method that prints the family’s last name and all the members’ details.

# Create an instance of the Family class, with the last name of your choice, and the below members. Then call all the methods you created in Point 2.

#     [
#         {'name':'Michael','age':35,'gender':'Male','is_child':False},
#         {'name':'Sarah','age':32,'gender':'Female','is_child':False}
#     ]

class Family:
    def __init__(self, last_name, members):
        self.last_name = last_name

    def born(self, **kwargs):
        self.members.append(kwargs)
        print(f"Congratulations to the {self.last_name} family on the birth of {kwargs['name']}!")

# Demonstrate the methods
family.born(name='John', age=0, gender='Male', is_child=True)
print(family.is_18('Michael'))
print(family.is_18('John'))
family.family_presentation()



# Exercise 5 : TheIncredibles Family
# Instructions
# Create a class called TheIncredibles. This class should inherit from the Family class:
# This is no random family they are an incredible family, therefore the members attributes, will be a list of dictionaries containing the additional keys : power and incredible_name. (See Point 4)


# Add a method called use_power, this method should print the power of a member only if they are over 18 years old. If not raise an exception (look up exceptions) which stated they are not over 18 years old.


# Add a method called incredible_presentation which :

# Print a sentence like “*Here is our powerful family **”
# Prints the family’s last name and all the members’ details (ie. use the super() function, to call the family_presentation method)


# Create an instance of the Incredibles class, with the “Incredibles” last name, and the below members.

#     [
#         {'name':'Michael','age':35,'gender':'Male','is_child':False,'power': 'fly','incredible_name':'MikeFly'},
#         {'name':'Sarah','age':32,'gender':'Female','is_child':False,'power': 'read minds','incredible_name':'SuperWoman'}
#     ]


# Call the incredible_presentation method.


# Use the born method inherited from the Family class to add Baby Jack with the following power: “Unknown Power”.


# Call the incredible_presentation method again.
