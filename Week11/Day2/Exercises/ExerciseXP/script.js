//Exercise 4: Todo List Using ES6 Module Syntax

//1. Create a directory named todoApp.

//2. Inside the todoApp directory, create two files: todo.js and app.js.

//3. In todo.js, define an ES6 module that exports a TodoList class.

//4. The TodoList class should have methods to add tasks, mark tasks as complete, and list all tasks.

//5. Export the TodoList class.

//6. In app.js, import the TodoList class from the todo.js module.

//7. Create an instance of the TodoList class.

//8. Add a few tasks, mark some as complete, and list all tasks.

//9. Run app.js and verify that the todo list operations are working correctly.


//Exercise 5: Creating And Using A Custom Module

//1. Create a directory named math-app.

//2. Inside the math-app directory, open a terminal and run npm init to initialize a new Node.js project. Follow the prompts to set up your project.

//3. Install the lodash package, a utility library, by running npm install lodash in the terminal.

//4. Create a file named math.js inside the math-app directory.

//5. In math.js, define a simple custom module that exports functions for addition and multiplication.

//6. Create a file named app.js in the same directory.

//7. In app.js, require the lodash package and the custom math module.

//8. Use the exported functions from the math module and the utility functions from the lodash package to perform calculations.

//9. Run app.js using Node.js and verify that the calculations are correct.


//Exercise 6: Simple NPM Package Usage

//1. Create a directory named npm-beginner.

//2. Inside the npm-beginner directory, open a terminal and run npm init to initialize a new Node.js project. Follow the prompts to set up your project.

//3. Install the chalk package, which provides easy coloring for terminal output, by running npm install chalk in the terminal.

//4. Create a file named app.js inside the npm-beginner directory.

//5. In app.js, require the chalk package and use it to color and style text in the terminal.

//6. Write a simple script that uses chalk to print a colorful message.

//7. Run app.js using Node.js and observe the colorful output in the terminal.


//Exercise 7: Reading And Copying Files

//1. Create a directory named file-explorer.

//2. Inside the file-explorer directory, create a file named copy-file.js.

//3. In copy-file.js, use the fs module to read the content from a file named source.txt and then write the same content to a new file named destination.txt.

//4. Create another file named read-directory.js.

//5. In read-directory.js, use the fs module to read the list of files in a specified directory and display their names in the terminal.

//6. Open a terminal in the file-explorer directory.

//7. Run node copy-file.js to copy the content from source.txt to destination.txt.

//8. Run node read-directory.js to list the files in the directory.
