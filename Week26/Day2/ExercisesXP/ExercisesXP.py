describe_city("Jerusalem")


# Exercise 4 : Random
# Instructions
# Create a function that accepts a number between 1 and 100 and generates another number randomly between 1 and 100.
# Compare the two numbers, if it’s the same number, display a success message, otherwise show a fail message and display both numbers.

import random

def compare_numbers(number):
    random_number = random.randint(1, 100)
    if number == random_number:
        print("Success!")
    else:
        print(f"Fail! The number was {random_number}, not {number}")

compare_numbers(50)


# 🌟 Exercise 5 : Let’s Create Some Personalized Shirts !

# Modify the make_shirt() function so that shirts are large by default with a message that reads “I love Python” by default.
# Make a large shirt with the default message
# Make medium shirt with the default message
# Make a shirt of any size with a different message.

# Bonus: Call the function make_shirt() using keyword arguments.

def make_shirt(size = "L", text = "I love Python"):
    print(f"The size of the shirt is {size} and the text is {text}")

make_shirt()
make_shirt("M")

# Call the function show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

magician_names = ['Harry Houdini', 'David Blaine', 'Criss Angel']

def show_magicians(magicians):
    for magician in magicians:
        print(magician)

def make_great(magicians):
    for i in range(len(magicians)):
